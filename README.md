# SWIGGY_DATA_ANALYTICS-USING-EXCEL
## Swiggy Sales & Performance Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

##  Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Excel-based data analytics portfolio project** built to analyze **food delivery sales performance** using Swiggy-like transactional data.

The objective is to transform raw data into **business insights** by defining **Business Requirements (BRD)**, identifying **KPIs**, and building an **interactive Excel dashboard** for decision-makers.

## Business Problem Statement
Food delivery platforms generate massive transactional data, but without analytics it is difficult to:
- Track overall revenue performance
- Measure customer satisfaction
- Identify top-performing cities and states
- Understand ordering trends by time and category

This dashboard solves these problems by providing a **centralized analytical view** of sales and customer behavior.
